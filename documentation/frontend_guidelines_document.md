# Qualee Frontend Guideline Document

This document outlines the frontend architecture, design principles, styling, component structure, state management, routing, performance optimizations, and testing strategy for **Qualee**, our PWA that gamifies customer reviews and offers a merchant dashboard. The goal is to ensure a clear, maintainable, and scalable frontend setup.

## 1. Frontend Architecture

### 1.1 Overall Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js (React) in PWA mode for customer-facing flows and the merchant dashboard.  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming.  
- **Internationalization:** i18next for string management and language detection.  
- **Data & Auth:** Supabase Client (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions).  
- **Payments & Emails:** Stripe.js for subscription billing and SendGrid for transactional emails.
- **Hosting:** Vercel for automatic builds and deployments.

### 1.2 Scalability & Maintainability
- **Component-Based Structure:** Promotes reuse and isolation of concerns.  
- **File-Based Routing:** Next.js pages folder provides clear route organization.  
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Speeds up load on low-traffic pages and supports SEO.  
- **Edge Functions:** Handle coupon expiration and email triggers close to the user.

### 1.3 Performance
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) + Static Generation:** Ensures fast first paint.  
- **Dynamic Imports & Code Splitting:** Only load heavy modules (e.g., Spin the Wheel) when needed.  
- **Image Optimization:** Next.js `<Image>` component for responsive, lazy-loaded images.

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 Usability
- **Clear CTAs:** One main action per screen (Scan QR, Rate, Spin, View Coupon).  
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Keep flows short—step by step prompts.

### 2.2 Accessibility
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:** Keyboard navigation, proper ARIA labels, high color contrast.  
- **Semantic HTML:** Use landmarks (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`).

### 2.3 Responsiveness
- **Mobile-First:** All screens start with a mobile layout, then scale up.  
- **Fluid Grids & Flexbox:** Tailwind’s responsive utility classes ensure layouts adapt.

### 2.4 Internationalization
- **Auto Language Detection:** Use browser locale to pick initial language.  
- **Fallback & Manual Switch:** Manual switch available for any translation gaps.

## 3. Styling and Theming

### 3.1 Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first for rapid development, customizing via `tailwind.config.js`.  
- **CSS Variables:** Define theme colors in `:root` and override in merchant vs. customer sections.

### 3.2 Theming
- **Customer Theme:** Playful, bright color palette.  
- **Dashboard Theme:** Neutral, muted tones for focus and data clarity.
- **Dark Mode (Future):** Plan to add via CSS variable toggles.

### 3.3 Visual Style
- **Style:** Flat & modern with subtle shadows (glassmorphism only for modal overlays).  
- **Font:** Inter (web-safe, readable at small sizes).  

### 3.4 Color Palette
| Role              | Customer Theme         | Dashboard Theme      |
|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Primary           | #FF6F61 (Coral)        | #4A5568 (Gray-700)   |
| Secondary         | #4CAF50 (Green)        | #A0AEC0 (Gray-400)   |
| Accent            | #FFC107 (Amber)        | #E2E8F0 (Gray-200)   |
| Background        | #FFFFFF (White)        | #F7FAFC (Gray-50)    |
| Text Primary      | #1A202C (Gray-900)     | #2D3748 (Gray-800)   |
| Success/Reward    | #38A169 (Green-600)    | —                    |
| Warning / Danger  | #E53E3E (Red-600)      | —                    |

## 4. Component Structure

### 4.1 Directory Layout (Example)
```
/components         # Reusable UI elements
  /atoms            # Buttons, Inputs, Icons
  /molecules        # Combined atoms (Modal, Form Field)
  /organisms        # Page sections (WheelGame, RatingPrompt)
  /templates        # Layouts (CustomerLayout, DashboardLayout)
/pages              # Next.js pages (SSR/ISR)
/public             # Static assets (images, fonts)
/utils              # Helpers (i18n, date formatting)
/services           # API clients (Supabase, Stripe)
```

### 4.2 Reuse & Isolation
- **Single Responsibility:** Each component does one thing well.  
- **Props-Driven:** Pass only needed data & callbacks.  
- **Storybook (Future):** Document components in isolation.

---

## 5. State Management

### 5.1 Data Fetching & Caching
- **React Query:** Handles async data calls to Supabase, caches results, and auto-refetches on focus.  
- **Supabase Hooks:** Supabase JS client wrapped in custom hooks (`useAuth`, `useStats`).

### 5.2 Global State
- **Context API:** For UI states (theme toggle, language).  
- **Local Component State:** For ephemeral UI states (spin result, form inputs).

### 5.3 Shared State
- **Auth State:** Stored in Context, persisted via Supabase Auth listener.  
- **Cart/Session:** Spin eligibility stored in LocalStorage to enforce “one spin per user.”

---

## 6. Routing and Navigation

### 6.1 File-Based Routes
- **Public Routes:** `/` (landing), `/rate/[shopId]`, `/spin`, `/coupon`.  
- **Protected Routes:** `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/stats`, `/dashboard/wheel`, `/dashboard/settings`.

### 6.2 Navigation Patterns
- **Next.js Link:** For internal navigation.  
- **Dynamic Params:** `[shopId]` to load shop-specific rating flows.  
- **Middleware (Future):** Check auth on protected routes.

---

## 7. Performance Optimization

### 7.1 Lazy Loading & Code Splitting
- **Dynamic Imports:** Wrap heavy modules (WheelGame, Chart libraries) in `next/dynamic`.  
- **Route-Based Splitting:** Each Next.js page becomes its own chunk.

### 7.2 Asset Optimization
- **Next/Image:** Automatic resizing and WebP support.  
- **SVG Icons:** Inline or via sprite for low overhead.

### 7.3 Caching & CDN
- **Vercel Edge Cache:** Static assets served via CDN.  
- **React Query Cache:** Keeps data fresh without extra network calls.

---

## 8. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 8.1 Unit Tests
- **Jest + React Testing Library:** Test components render, callbacks fire, accessibility queries.

### 8.2 Integration Tests
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker):** Mock Supabase and Stripe APIs to test flows without real calls.

### 8.3 End-to-End Tests
- **Cypress:** Script key user journeys:
  - QR code landing → star rating → feedback or spin → coupon display.
  - Merchant login → create QR → view stats → manage wheel.

### 8.4 Linting & Formatting
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Enforce code style and catch errors early.  
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Run `lint-staged` and tests on commit.

### 8.5 CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions:** On every PR, run lint, unit tests, and build.  
- **Vercel Deployment:** On merge to `main`, auto-deploy to production.
